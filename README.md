# `mpp`

Various useful scripts from over the years. This repository is mainly a way 
to share small tools with others. These tools work on my machine, and aren't
necessarily safe to use on yours right out of the box. Read before running.

## Components

**FlameGraph** - scripts for making flame graphs from pprof outputs.

**golang** - Go installation script.

**shout** - shell output formatting functions.
